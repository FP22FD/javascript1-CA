# javascript1-CA

<!-- A simple overview of use/purpose. -->

Noroff Course Assignment for JavaScript1.

## Description

<!-- An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use. -->

The main goal of this repository is to make a call to a pubblic API URL.The CA focuses on JavaScript, not styling, so I made a simple website with 3 pages, `I Love Movie`.

The website design and implementation has been made with `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript`:

## Level 1 Process

Search for a public, free-to-use API:

- To fetch an array of results
- To fetch a single result using an id, name, or other property
- Note: Both API calls should include a loading indicator;

Index.html:

- To fetch an array of results
- call to your API URL
- Loop through the results and create HTML for each result.
- Display at least 3 different properties
- Catch any errors and display a message;

Details.html:

- Make an API call using the URL
- Display at least 3 different properties from the received JSON
- Catch any errors and display a message;

Contact.html:

- Create a form with the inputs and validation rules
- Write code to validate the input after page is submitted
- Display an error message for the the inputs fail validation;

## Level 2 Process

Contact.html:

- Write code if all validation passes;

## Learning Outcomes

- knowledge of the Document Object Model (DOM)
- knowledge of JavaScript Events that are used to create interactive solutions
- knowledge or methods used to make API calls to retrieve data from servers
- knowledge of JavaScript syntax and structure
- knowledge of key methods for debugging JavaScript
- knowledge of tools and techniques to create interactive solutions with JavaScript Events and API calls

## Dependencies

<!-- - Describe any prerequisites, libraries, OS version, etc., needed before installing the program.
- ex. Windows 10 -->

To develop the website I have used `Visual Studio Code` with `Prettier` formatter extension.

No other tools, libraries or frameworks are required to compile or run the website.
